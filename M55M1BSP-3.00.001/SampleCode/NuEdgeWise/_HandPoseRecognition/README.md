# HandPoseRecognition
The hand pose recognition sample is reference to Kazuhito's [hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe](https://github.com/Kazuhito00/hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe) to complete. In this sample, it used two models. First, using the hand landmark model to detects the keypoint localization of 21 hand-knuckle coordinates. Then record the trajectory of the index finger keypoint and use a point history classifier model to classify the current hand posture is stopped, moving, clockwise or counter clockwise.
